    "- Flip the data images horizontally and take the opposite sign of the steering angles:  This technique helps to balance out the right and left turn in the race track which may help to reduce the left turn bias as you can observe in the dataset.  You can see the codes of this flipping technique in the function **data_flip()** in the **model8.py** \n",

    "- Instead of using only center camera image data for training and validation, I used all three cameras: left, center, right.  For the left camera, I added a small 0.12 angle coefficient to compensate for the left turn bias effects.  For the right camera, I did the opposite way by subtracting the 0.12 angle coefficient to take care of the scenarios if the car may go to far to the right.  You can see the codes of using three cameras in the function **generator()** in the **model8.py**\n",

You can see the codes of using randomly brightness effects in the function **augment_brightness** in the **model8.py**\n",

    "In addition to the bias data which I discussed above, I also normalized the data to zero mean and cropped the image data by using the Kera function **Cropping2D**.  I was using 45 pixel top, and 20 pixel bottom cropping technique and this seems to help to reduce noises in the data training.

This MSE is very typical technique in ML to look at errors during data training.\n",

Therefore, I didn't use any dropout techniques in this project. Initially, I played around by adding the dropout functions in my model.  Adding dropout function seemed to cause my model taking a longer time to converge.  I had to increase the number of epochs=10+ for my model to converge and the final plot of traing and validation loss seemed very much the same as if I didn't use the dropout functions.  \n",
